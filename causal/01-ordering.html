<h3>Partial orders<a class="headerlink" href="#partial-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial ordering</a> is a set of elements with a binary relation ≤ that is
reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. It can be represented as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed
acyclic graph</a> (DAG), where nodes represent the elements, and paths represent
the relationships. Using this structure, we can begin to model messages in a
distributed system for a group communications session.</p>
<p>Each node m ∈ M represents a message, sent by a sender u ∈ U. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nsep" id="id1">[1]</a>
The relation a ≤ b (a &#8220;before&#8221; b) means that the sender of b knew the
contents of a, when they wrote b. As a shortcut, let us also define ≥
(&#8220;after&#8221;) such that a ≥ b ⇔ b ≤ a, and ⊥ (&#8220;independent&#8221;) such
that a ⊥ b ⇔ (¬ a ≤ b ∧ ¬ a ≥ b). Note that in a partial
order, ¬ (a ≤ b) does <em>not</em> imply a ≥ b.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, where an edge a ← b means that a ≤ b,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>red nodes (and m <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nnat" id="id2">[2]</a>) are <em>before</em> m; all others are <em>not-before</em> m.</li>
<li>green nodes (and m) are <em>after</em> m; all others are <em>not-after</em> m.</li>
<li>grey nodes are neither before nor after m, but <em>causally independent</em> of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since ≤ is transitive, a ≤ b means that the sender of b knows all
messages before a as well. (We&#8217;ll talk about how to enforce this in a real
system soon.) As a shortcut, define <strong>anc(m)</strong> = {a | a ≤ m}, i.e. the set
of ancestors of m, including m. This set can be interpreted as the possible
&#8220;causes&#8221; of m, like the discrete equivalent of a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone">light cone</a>.</p>
<p>In our scheme, each message m declares its immediate predecessors P =
<strong>pre(m)</strong>. This defines a few relationships: ∀ p ∈ P: p &lt; m. (This
is why we drew ← for ≤ in the above graph, rather than
→ - the references belong to the later message; one cannot predict
in advance what messages will come after yours.) <em>Immediate</em> means that there
is nothing between them, i.e. ∄ q: p &lt; q &lt; m. One result of this is
that all parents (from now on we&#8217;ll exclusively use this term) must be causally
independent of each other (&#8220;form an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain">anti-chain</a>&#8221;).</p>
<p>Our definition means that pre(m) forms a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction">transitive reduction</a> of ≤. This
eliminates redundant information from the contents of a message. This is good,
because redundant information is a security liability - it needs to be checked
for consistency, from the &#8220;canonical&#8221; sources of the information, but then we
might as well use those sources to directly calculate this information. Here,
enforcing immediacy and independence actually lets us achieve some stronger
guarantees &#8220;for free&#8221; - e.g., protection against rewinding of vector clocks;
see next section.</p>
<p>References must be globally consistent and immutable - i.e. to see a reference
allows one to verify the message contents, and no-one can forge a different
message for which the reference is valid, not even the original sender. One
simple implementation option is use a hash of the ciphertext as the reference.
(Those familiar with Git will see the similarities with their model of
immutable commit objects.) <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#encoding-message-identifiers"><span>Defining message identifiers</span></a> explores this
and alternatives in more detail.</p>
<p>There are two ways to know a valid reference - deriving it from the message
contents, or seeing it elsewhere (e.g. in pre(m) of a child) <em>without having
seen</em> the message itself. That is, a member could make a false declaration that
they&#8217;ve seen a real message, if they see someone else refer to it - and no-one
can detect whether this declaration is false or true. (Note that this is a
distinct case from falsely declaring that one has seen a fake i.e non-existent
message, which <em>can</em> be detected as described further below.)</p>
<p>We assume that people won&#8217;t do this - there is no strategic benefit in claiming
to know something that you are entitled to know but temporarily don&#8217;t. The
worst that may happen is that someone issues a challenge you cannot answer, but
only your reputation would suffer. Also, if you haven&#8217;t seen the message, you
are unable to verify that the reference is indeed valid, so someone else might
be trying to trick <em>you</em>. However, if this security assessment turns out to be
wrong, there are <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#author-specific-message-identifiers"><span>measures</span></a> we can
take to close this hole, but they are more complex so we ignore them for now.</p>

<h3>Causal orders<a class="headerlink" href="#causal-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Partial orders can be used to describe the relative ordering of neutral events.
In a causal order, we introduce agents that can observe and generate events. In
the context of messaging, each event is a message with exactly one <em>sender</em> and
a set of <em>recipients</em>, collectively called its <em>members</em>. Define <strong>by(u)</strong> as
the set of all messages sent by u. This set is totally-ordered on ≤, i.e.
every element is either before or after every other. Roughly, this constrains
the number of branches that may exist at any point, and helps the graph be
&#8220;more linear&#8221;.</p>
<p>Often, we&#8217;ll find it useful to refer to the subjective session-view that a
sender has when they send a message. Define <strong>context(m)</strong> as a mapping
members(m) → anc(m), such that context(m)(u) is the latest message
by u seen by the sender of m, or ⊥ (&#8220;null&#8221;) if no such message exists.
Formally:</p>
<p>context(m): members(m) → anc(m) = u ↦ max(by(u) ∩ anc(m))</p>
<p>where max() gives the maximum element of a totally-ordered set, or ⊥ if it
is empty. We say a context c ⊏ c&#8217; (&#8220;strictly less advanced&#8221;) iff
∀ u: c(u) = ⊥ ∨ c(u) ≤ c&#8217;(u) and c ≠ c&#8217;.</p>
<p>Unlike pre(m) and members(m), by(u) depends implicitly on the set of messages
that have been delivered so far, so might more accurately be denoted T.by(u),
where T is the current transcript. Though context(m) also refers to other
messages, any valid transcript that contains m must already contain anc(m) and
therefore context(m), so it is unambiguous regardless of the transcript.</p>
<p>Context is semantically equivalent to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector clock</a>. As with vector clocks,
malicious senders may &#8220;rewind&#8221; the context they are supposed to declare with
each message. If this redundant information is trusted, this enables certain
re-ordering attacks. For example, I should not be allowed to claim that my
last-received-from-A is 9, if I&#8217;ve already claimed that my last-received-from-B
is 12, but in message 12, B claimed that their last-received-from-A is 10. (A
more simple version of this with only 2 members is in the diagram below.)</p>
<p>To protect against this, we introduce <em>context consistency</em>: all messages must
have a context that is strictly more advanced than the context of strictly
earlier messages. Or, in other words, a message may not declare a parent that
is before a parent of a strictly earlier message. Formally:</p>
<p>∀ m&#8217;, m ∈ &lt;: context(m&#8217;) ⊏ context(m) (or equivalently)
∀ p&#8217; ∈ pre(m&#8217;), p ∈ pre(m): ¬ p ≤ p&#8217; (TODO: prove the equiv)</p>

<p>Context consistency forbids the 1 ← 4 reference. This may seem like
quite a complex property to enforce, but actually we do not need to directly
enforce it.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <em>transitive reduction</em> entails <em>context consistency</em>. Proof
sketch: if m&#8217; &lt; m then ∃ p ∈ pre(m): m&#8217; ≤ p &lt; m. Since ≤ is
transitive, ∀ p&#8217; ∈ pre(m&#8217;): p&#8217; &lt; p ≡ anc(p&#8217;) ⊂ anc(p).
By transitive reduction, no other q ≠ p ∈ pre(m) may belong to anc(p), so
q ∉ anc(p&#8217;) ≡ ¬ q ≤ p&#8217; (for all p&#8217;, q) as required. []</p>
<p>So, we recommend that a real implementation should not encode context(m)
explicitly, since it generally has redundant information that will need to be
checked. Instead, one should enforce that pre(m) is an anti-chain (see below),
which automatically achieves context consistency. Then, one may locally
calculate context(m) from pre(m), using the following recursive algorithm:

<h2>Enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reflexivity and anti-symmetry do not need special protocol-level behaviour to
enforce; implementations might check their own correctness with unit tests.</p>
<p>Enforcing transitivity means we must show messages to the user in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort">topological
order</a>. For each incoming m, if any of its parents p ∈ pre(m) have not yet
been delivered <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ndlv" id="id3">[3]</a>, we place m in a buffer, and wait for all of pre(m) to
be delivered first before delivering m. This allows us to verify that the
parent references are actually of real messages. To protect against DoS, the
buffer should be limited in size; see the next section for details.</p>
<p>The result is that we deliver all of anc(m) before we deliver m, i.e. the user
sees anc(m) before m. This applies for messages the user sends too, assuming we
set the parents correctly. This achieves transitivity on the local side, but it
is quite hard to detect whether <em>other</em> members are doing this. (One option is
to require m to mention <em>all</em> of anc(m), but obviously this costs too much
bandwidth.) But earlier, we argued that there is no incentive for users to
cheat this; we will make this assumption going forward.</p>
<p>Enforcing transitive reduction can be done using only information from m and
anc(m). Since messages are only added to the data structure in topological
order, everyone has this information so they can enforce it themselves.
Messages that break this may simply be dropped, with a local UI warning as to
the source. The <a class="reference internal" href="04-state.html#merge-algorithm"><span>merge algorithm for DAGs</span></a> includes a
check that the inputs form an anti-chain, and it may be run on the pre(m) of
every message accepted, including for single-parent messages.</p>
<p>Enforcing total ordering can be done only when someone accepts messages from
both forks, which not everyone else might see. To help this propagate, users
that see this condition, must re-broadcast all messages within both forks to
everyone else, then leave the conversation with a BAIL error message (TODO:
elaborate possible errors) that references both forks. Note that one of the
references may have to be indirect if we already replied to the other fork, to
preserve transitive reduction. We should never need to do this for a triple
fork; bail should be immediate upon attempting to deliver a double fork. It is
not essential that everyone receives this, since lack of future participation
will indicate that something is wrong, but this helps to narrow down the cause.</p>

<h3>Detecting transport attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#detecting-transport-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By &#8220;transport attacks&#8221;, we mean replays, re-orders, and drops of packets, by an
attacker that can affect the physical communications infrastructure. We assume
that external cryptographic authentication will allow us to detect packets
injected by a non-member.</p>
<p>Detecting replays is easy, assuming that our decryption scheme verify-decrypts
duplicate packets so that they have the same parents (and contents and other
metadata); then this will be deserialised into an already-existing node in our
transcript graph. If we cache the ciphertext (and there is <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#single-ciphertext"><span>reason to</span></a>), we don&#8217;t even need to verify-decrypt it the second time.</p>
<p>Enforcing transitivity is basically an exercise in correcting the order of
messages, so we are already covered there.</p>
<p>For drops, let&#8217;s consider &#8220;causal drops&#8221; first - drops of messages that caused
(are <em>before</em>) a message we <em>have</em> already received. Messages in the delivery
buffer will have three types of parents: those already accepted, those also in
the buffer, and those that haven&#8217;t been seen yet. For the last case, this is
either because the parent p doesn&#8217;t exist (the sender is lying), or because the
transport is being unreliable or malicious.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t assume the transport is reliable, so we should give it a grace period
within which to expect p to arrive. After this expires, we should assume that
we&#8217;ll never receive p for whatever reason, emit a UI warning (&#8220;referenced
message p didn&#8217;t arrive on time&#8221;), and drop messages that transitively point to
p from the buffer. This is safe even if p turns out to be real and we receive
it later; others&#8217; <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#reliability"><span>reliability</span></a> schemes will detect this and
resend us the dropped messages. If we do eventually receive p later, we should
cancel the warning, or at least downgrade its severity, based on how timely we
expect the transport to be.</p>
<p>If we never receive p, we cannot know <em>for sure</em> whether the sender was lying
or the transport was malicious. In the basic case, there is no incentive for
the sender to lie, but if we just <em>assume</em> the transport is malicious (and take
some action A in response to this) then ironically we <em>give</em> the sender an
incentive to lie - they can frame the transport to induce us to do A, which may
have unintended consequences. So, we should be careful in how we communicate
this fault to the user, and not imply blame on any party.</p>
<p>Detecting <em>non-causal drops</em> - drops of messages not-before a message we&#8217;ve
already received, and therefore we don&#8217;t see any references to - is more
complex, and we will cover this in <a class="reference internal" href="03-freshness.html"><em>freshness</em></a>.</p>
<p>If the first message has replay protection (e.g. if it is fresh), we also
inductively gain this for the entire session. This is because each message
contains unforgeable references to previous parent messages, so everything is
&#8220;anchored&#8221; to the first non-replayable message.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="buffering-and-asynchronous-operation">
<h2>Buffering and asynchronous operation<a class="headerlink" href="#buffering-and-asynchronous-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our strong ordering (transitivity) approach requires a reliable transport. If a
message is dropped, this prevents later messages from being displayed. We can
improve this with end-to-end recovery (explained <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#reliability"><span>next</span></a>),
but this is less effective in an asynchronous scenario, i.e. where members may
not online at the same time. We depend more heavily on a third-party service to
store-and-forward messages in an intelligent way, e.g. to resend ciphertext
even if the original sender is offline. In the worst case where no two members
are online simultaneously, this dependency becomes an absolute <em>requirement</em>.</p>
<p>Such a service must provide the interface &#8220;send ciphertext T to recipient R&#8221;.
By itself, this should not reduce data security, since we assume there is an
attacker that already stores all ciphertext. (Metadata security is a harder
problem that is outside of our current scope - but at least this architecture
is no worse than existing transports.)</p>
<p>This adds extra development cost in a real application: at present there are
architectural issues with some existing asynchronous delivery or &#8220;push&#8221; systems
that make this sort of reliability awkward; email works, but leaks significant
mounts of metadata. However, we believe that there is demand for a general
reliable asynchronous transport as a piece of core internet infrastructure,
which would be useful for many other services and applications too. So, at
least within the scope of this document, we will work with this assumption, to
clearly divide our problem between security and asynchronous reliability.</p>
<p>We may also explore quasi-reliability schemes, that avoid buffering but still
provide strong ordering. For example, if the transport can deliver large
packets without splitting them, then whenever the user sends a message m, we
can &#8220;piggyback&#8221; all messages from anc(m) that are not <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#full-ack"><span>fully-acked</span></a> alongside m. So no-one will ever see messages out-of-order, thus
avoiding buffering. This exists already as an ad-hoc practice in email, where
often people leave a quoted parent in the body of their own message.</p>
<p>This is not a full replacement for a reliable transport - if unacked, packets
get larger and larger, and the ability to deliver them in one piece effectively
becomes a reliability problem. However, it could greatly improve the buffer
waiting period for the majority of unreliable cases, and does not require any
complex behaviour on the part of the always-online store-and-forward server.</p>
<p>Other approaches forfeit reliability, and display messages immediately upon
receipt even if received out-of-order. Such strategies necessarily break our
strong ordering property which we consider critical, so we won&#8217;t discuss them
further here - but see <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#consistency-without-reliability"><span>Consistency without reliability</span></a> for a more
detailed exploration down this path.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-importance-of-strong-ordering">
<h2>The importance of strong ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-strong-ordering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is common for messages to depend on context for their precise meaning, in
both natural and computer languages; delivering such messages out-of-order is
not even <em>semantically correct</em>. We conjecture that these context-dependent
messages are a majority, based on briefly scanning our own mailboxes and thread
histories. One might argue that humans are pretty good at reconstructing the
order ourselves, but this places an extra burden on the user.</p>
<p>Some have argued that strong ordering is not important for asynchronous and/or
high-latency use cases, and therefore buffering is not worth the supposed UX
cost. But receiving messages out-of-order is <em>itself a UX cost</em>. Futher, strong
ordering may not be important in some cases, but this is definitely not always
true - we can imagine scenarios where critical meetings might take place over
several days, where integrity is more important than timeliness. Therefore, we
think it&#8217;s prudent to prioritise achieving strong security then try to optimise
the UX around this, rather than vice-versa.</p>
<p>Generally, even asynchronous transports are mostly reliable - otherwise they
would have no users. Now, let&#8217;s consider this minority case where out-of-order
delivery might actually occur. Suppose Alice sends message (1) then (2), and
Bob&#8217;s machine receives (2) after time <em>t</em>. The only case where Bob would prefer
to be shown (2) before/without (1) being available, is if (2) does not require
(1) to be understood correctly. As previously conjectured, we assume this is a
minority (of an outer minority). Then, we have the following cases:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Bob receives (1) after a further time <em>t&#8217;</em> &lt; <em>t</em>.</li>
<li>Bob receives (1) after a further time <em>t&#8217;</em> &gt; <em>t</em>.</li>
<li>Bob doesn&#8217;t receive (1) at all, after some timeout <em>T</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We argue that most users won&#8217;t notice (a), that (b) and (c) are more problems
of the transport that incentivises users towards better transports regardless
of whether buffering is done, and that (c) can further be effectively handled
under our system via timeouts and by restarting the session, such as described
in <a class="reference internal" href="../hci.html#hci-ordering"><span>Messages received out-of-order</span></a>.</p>
<p>One might argue that scenarios where strong ordering is security-critical is
also a minority, but we feel it&#8217;s better to achieve this much-needed security
for this minority, than to achieve slightly more convenience for another
less-needy minority.</p>
<p>TODO: describe a hybrid scheme, using lossy ratchets to derive a &#8220;session key&#8221;,
and using this as the long-term key (instead of the real long-term key) in a
strongly-ordered ratchet. this prevents &#8220;drop attacks&#8221; from forcing users to
repeatedly use their long-term key for messaging material.</p>
